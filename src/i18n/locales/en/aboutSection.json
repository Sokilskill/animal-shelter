    "content": "The shelter constantly houses 350 adults and 20 puppies. The numbers change depending on the speed of placements.\nIt all started with compassion for the many abandoned animals in the city, whose fate no one cared about. Through the personal efforts and funds of volunteers and caring people, we started rehoming and sterilizing animals to reduce the number of strays.\nOver the years, we sterilize over 400 animals per year, and about 240 homeless animals find a home, with some even being rehomed abroad. We are constantly improving the conditions for the dogs, carrying out repairs to kennels, landscaping the shelter grounds, and vaccinating dogs to prevent disease outbreaks.\n\nOur work requires a lot of effort, both physical and financial. The city's support is limited to sterilization and castration, while all other expenses, including salaries, utility payments, repairs, and treatment of sick animals, are covered by volunteers and donations.\n\nWe sincerely hope that our work is not in vain and that people around the world will support us!",
